This project utilizes React for building the user interface, TypeScript for enhanced code maintainability and type safety, and Zustand as a lightweight and efficient state management solution. Furthermore, the project is bootstrapped using Vite, a blazing-fast build tool. The technologies employed are therefore React, TypeScript, and Zustand, all within a Vite-powered environment.
